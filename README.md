# Text-Formatting
In this project we are going to journey back to the 1970s, and implement a simple text formatting tool based entirely on fixed-width terminal fonts and character-based output.3 The formatting “commands” will be indicated by input lines that start with a period, “.”, with the command indicated by the letter in the next character position. For example, the characters “.p” in the first two positions of a line are (in this simple language) the signal to start a new paragraph in the output.

# Topics covered
In this project, I need to demonstrate my understanding of arrays, strings, and functions. I may also use typedefs and structs if you wish (see Chapter 8) – and will probably find the program easier to assemble if I do – but I am not required to use them in order to obtain full marks. I should not make any use of malloc() (Chapter 10) or file operations (Chapter 11) in this project.
